# GeoFleetic Documentation

> **The fleet that learns where. Spatial digital twins, federated route learning, and GNN optimization for geo-distributed intelligence.**

Welcome to the documentation hub for **GeoFleetic** — the spatial intelligence
layer of the [&] Protocol ecosystem. GeoFleetic provides geo-distributed fleet
tracking, federated route learning, and GNN-based route optimization — all running
on the BEAM for fault tolerance and real-time concurrency.

GeoFleetic is the `&space` primitive provider, exposing `&space.fleet`,
`&space.route`, and `&space.geofence` capability contracts to the rest of the
[&] stack.

## The Problem

Fleet management systems today are centralized, batch-oriented, and privacy-hostile.
A logistics company with 10,000 vehicles streams all GPS data to a cloud API, which
returns routes computed on stale models. The fleet learns nothing from yesterday's
deliveries. Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) make centralizing raw location data
increasingly untenable. And when the cloud API goes down, the fleet goes blind.

GeoFleetic provides spatial intelligence that:
- **Lives at the edge** — each vehicle reasons locally with sub-second latency
- **Learns continually** — routes improve from every delivery, not quarterly retraining
- **Preserves privacy** — shares model updates, never raw trajectories
- **Tolerates partitions** — vehicles operate offline and reconcile when reconnected
- **Composes with other intelligence** — spatial context enriches upstream reasoning
